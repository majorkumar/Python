The variable sentence stores a string. Write code to determine how many words in sentence start and end with the same letter, including one-letter words. Store the result in the variable same_letter_count.

sentence = "students flock to the arb for a variety of outdoor activities such as jogging and picnicking"

sentence = sentence.split(' ')

same_letter_count = 0 
for i in sentence:
    if(i[0] == i[-1]):
        same_letter_count = same_letter_count +1
    else:
        pass
print(same_letter_count)
