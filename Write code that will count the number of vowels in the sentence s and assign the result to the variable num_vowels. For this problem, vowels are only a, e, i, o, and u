Write code that will count the number of vowels in the sentence s and assign the result to the variable num_vowels. For this problem, vowels are only a, e, i, o, and u

s = "singing in the rain and playing in the rain are two entirely different situations but both can be fun"

vowels = ['a','e','i','o','u']
num_vowels = 0

for i in s:
    if('a' in i):
        num_vowels = num_vowels + 1
    elif('e' in i):
        num_vowels = num_vowels + 1
    elif('i' in i):
        num_vowels = num_vowels + 1
    elif('o' in i):
        num_vowels = num_vowels + 1
    elif('u' in i):
        num_vowels = num_vowels + 1
    else:
        pass
print(num_vowels)
