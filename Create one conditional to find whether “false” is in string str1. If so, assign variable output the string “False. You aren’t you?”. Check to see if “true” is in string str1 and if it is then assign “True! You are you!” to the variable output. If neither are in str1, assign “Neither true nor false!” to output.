Create one conditional to find whether “false” is in string str1. If so, assign variable output the string “False. You aren’t you?”. Check to see if “true” is in string str1 and if it is then assign “True! You are you!” to the variable output. If neither are in str1, assign “Neither true nor false!” to output.

str1 = "Today you are you! That is truer than true ! There is no one alive who is you-er than you!"

str1 = str1.split(" ")

for i in str1:
    print(i)
    if(i == "false"):
        output1 = ("False. You aren’t you?")
    elif(i == "true"):
        output = ("True! You are you!")
    else:
        output2 = ("Neither true nor false!")
print(output)
