Write code that counts the number of words in sentence that contain either an “a” or an “e”. Store the result in the variable num_a_or_e.

sentence = "python is a high level general purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems."
sentence = sentence.split(' ')
num_a_or_e = 0

for i in sentence:
    if('a' in i):
        num_a_or_e = num_a_or_e + 1
    elif('e' in i):
        num_a_or_e = num_a_or_e + 1
    else:
        pass
print(num_a_or_e)
